\lettercontent{Dear Recruiter,}

\lettercontent{I am a developer making a career change from data analytics to software engineering. I realized I enjoyed building and maintaining applications that used data more than presenting the analytics. My recent academic and professional results showcase my passion for solving problems with code.}

   
\lettercontent{Currently, I tutor students of all ages. I must use clear and concise language to teach everything from basic OO programming to constructing and manipulating data structures. I have been recognized repeatedly while earning my master's in computer science. For example, Professor Joyner at GA Tech recognized my AI program as an exemplary project.}

\lettercontent{I am a passionate, life-long learner. I have applied to fulfill the role at \company because I believe \company is full of the most intelligent people in the industry. I hope to grow and continue to contribute to my team. To further illustrate my fit for your team, contact me at \href{alejandrojsdiaz@outlook.com}{alejandrojsdiaz@outlook.com}.}

\lettercontent{Thank you for your time and consideration.}
\lettercontent{Sincerely,}
